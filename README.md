## Telemetry testbed topology

## Deploying, playing with, and destroying the topology

### Building custom Docker image for Linux clients

```
$ cd docker/
$ sudo docker build -t girosdit/clab-telemetry-testbed-ubuntu:latest .
```

### Deploying the topology

To deploy the topology, simply run the deploy shell script:

```
$ ./deploy-testbed-lab.sh
```

### Interacting with containers

For **CSR routers**, via SSH to open the CISCO CLI (password is `admin`):
```
$ ssh admin@clab-telemetry-testbed-r1 # For r1 router

(or)

$ ssh admin@clab-telemetry-testbed-r2 # For r2 router
```

or with `docker exec` to open an interactive `bash` Linux shell:
```
$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-testbed-r1 bash # For r1 router

(or)

$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-testbed-r2 bash # For r2 router
```

For **Linux containers (clients)**, with `docker exec` to open an interactive shell:
```
$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-testbed-c1 /bin/sh # For c1 client container

(or)

$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-testbed-c2 /bin/sh # For c2 client container
```

### Creation of YANG-Push subscriptions to telemetry data through the NETCONF protocol

In this testbed, YANG-Push subscriptions can be triggered to telemetry data from the Cisco IOS XE CSR1000V network devices, which support YANG data modeling, via the NETCONF protocol. A NETCONF client Python library called [`ncclient`](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient) is used. This library allows to create dynamic susbcription to YANG modeled data by means of RPC operations in order to receive notifications. The subscription can be of the _on-change_ type or _periodic_ type, and depending on the data to subscribe to, one type of subscription or another will be accepted (see the [Known limitations about YANG-Push](#known-limitations-about-yang-push) section for more details).

There is a simple Python script `ncclient-scripts/csr-create-subscription.py` that allows you to make on-change or periodic subscriptions to an XPath of a specific YANG model for a Cisco IOS XE CSR1000V node. The script allows parameterizing the container name of the network device, the XPath, the type of subscription, and the time of the subscription period in centiseconds in the case of periodic subscriptions.

To create YANG-Push subscription, run the Python script as follows:
```
$ python3 csr-create-subscription.py <container_name> <XPath> <subscription_type> [<period_in_cs>]
```

> **Periodic subscription example:**
> 
>```
>$ python3 csr-create-subscription.py clab-telemetry-testbed-r1 "/interfaces-state/interface[name='GigabitEthernet2']" periodic 1000
>```
 
> **On-change subscription example:**
> 
>```
>$ python3 csr-create-subscription.py clab-telemetry-testbed-r1 "/native/hostname" on-change
>```

### Destroying the topology

To destroy the topology, simply run the destroy shell script:

```
$ ./destroy-testbed-lab.sh
```

## IXIA-C laboratory topology
This lab consists of a [`Keysight ixia-c-one`](https://containerlab.dev/manual/kinds/keysight_ixia-c-one/) node with 2 ports connected to incoming port on `r1` node and the outgoing port on `r2` node via two point-to-point ethernet links. The nodes are also connected with their management interfaces to the containerlab docker network. This lab is based on the [_Keysight IXIA-C and Nokia SR Linux_](https://containerlab.dev/lab-examples/ixiacone-srl/) lab example of ContainerLab.

`Keysight ixia-c-one` is a single-container distribution of [ixia-c](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c), which in turn is Keysight's reference implementation of [Open Traffic Generator API](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models). 

This lab allows users to validate an IPv4 traffic forwarding scenario between Keysight `ixia-c-one` and Cisco IOS XE CSR1000v nodes (i.e., `r1` and `r2`).

## Deploying, playing with, and destroying the topology

### Deploying the topology

To deploy the topology, simply run the deploy shell script:

```
$ ./deploy-ixiac-lab.sh
```

### Interacting with containers

For **CSR routers**, via SSH to open the CISCO CLI (password is `admin`):
```
$ ssh admin@clab-telemetry-ixiac-lab-r1 # For r1 router

(or)

$ ssh admin@clab-telemetry-ixiac-lab-r2 # For r2 router
```

or with `docker exec` to open an interactive `bash` Linux shell:
```
$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-ixiac-lab-r1 bash # For r1 router

(or)

$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-ixiac-lab-r2 bash # For r2 router
```

For **IXIA-C container**, with `docker exec` to open an interactive shell:
```
$ sudo docker exec -it clab-telemetry-ixiac-lab-ixia-c /bin/sh
```

Inside the ixia-c container shell, with `docker ps -a` you can see the `ixia-c controller` and `traffic engine` containers:
```
/home/keysight/ixia-c-one # docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                            NAMES

```

### Generating synthetic traffic with IXIA-C

This lab demonstrates a simple IPv4 traffic forwarding scenario where,

- One `Keysight ixia-c-one` port acts as a transmit port and the other as receive port. Two-way communication can be configured (i.e., `ixia-c-port1` <-> `r1` <-> `r2` <-> `ixia-c-port2`).
- Cisco IOS XE CSR1000v nodes (i.e., `r1` and `r2`) are configured to forward the traffic in either of the two directions of communication using static routes configuration in the default network instance.

When the lab is running, we need to fetch the MAC address according to the incoming interface of the router node which is connected to the transmit port of `ixia-c-one` node. Execute the following script to get the incoming MAC addresses of both router nodes, as they will serve as an argument in the traffic test scripts:
```
$ ./discover_target_mac.sh
```

Run the traffic tests with MAC addresses obtained in previous step:

- For the traffic test `ixia-c-port1` -> `r1` -> `r2` -> `ixia-c-port2`:
```
cd ixia-c-scripts/
go run ipv4_forwarding_r1_r2.go -dstMac="<incoming MAC address of r1>"
```

- For the traffic test `ixia-c-port2` -> `r2` -> `r1` -> `ixia-c-port1`:
```
cd ixia-c-scripts/
go run ipv4_forwarding_r2_r1.go -dstMac="<incoming MAC address of r2>"
```

The tests are configured to send 1000 IPv4 packets with a rate 100pps from 10.10.10.1 to 10.20.20.X or from 10.20.20.1 to 10.10.10.X, where x is changed from 1 to 5. Once 1000 packets are sent, the test script checks that we received all the sent packets.


### Destroying the topology

To destroy the topology, simply run the destroy shell script:

```
$ ./destroy-ixiac-lab.sh
```

### Known limitations about YANG-Push

- `YANG-Push` on-change notifications do not work with all datastores. There is a proposed-standard method to know which YANG modules support this kind of notifications (see RFC 9196 linked below), but it is not implemented, at least in the 17.03.04a version of CISCO's IOS XE operating system. YANG modules`ietf-interfaces`, `openconfig-interfaces` and `cisco-ios-xe-interfaces-oper` do not allow this type of notifications, not even for `oper/admin-status` nodes. Periodic notifications work without issues. According to RFC 8641, page 17, chapter 3.10 (also linked below), "_a publisher supporting on-change notifications may not be able to push on-change updates for some object types_", and some reasons for this are given. While there is an additional method to, apparently, know which modules support on-change notifications (`show platform software ndbman {R0|RP} models` command in IOS CLI) (see [this link](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/1612/b_1612_programmability_cg/model_driven_telemetry.html#id_90796)), it does not seem to match the experimented results.
